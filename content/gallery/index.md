Welcome to my little photo gallery! I take most of my pictures with a Fujifilm X-T30 II. I experiment with different recipes and will do my best to label them, but I’m still fairly new to this and haven’t yet developed a defined style or the best system for organizing my photos.
## Balboa Park and the Japanese Friendship Gardan

These are the first pictures I’ve taken with my camera so far. Understanding how to work with the exposure triangle has been a bit challenging, but luckily, San Diego has plenty of sunny days, which makes finding good lighting a bit easier.

I first saw cherry blossoms in Washington, DC, when I ran my first half marathon in 2022. I think they, along with the Jacarandas in my hometown, are some of the most beautiful colors I’ve ever seen. So hearing that San Diego has some made me really happy.

## Morelia, Michoacán

I loved growing up in Morelia. I was always lucky to have amazing friends and great experiences here. The food is incredible, the weather is pretty good—though not quite as nice as in San Diego. At first, I didn’t fully notice the beautiful colors that make this place unique, like the Jacarandas, the Cantera Rosa, and so many other iconic hues. But when I started taking photography a little more 'seriously,' I began to appreciate them, and I’m so glad I did.

## Meseta Purepecha

By the end of the winter quarter, I took a quick trip to Morelia and went on a small road trip to Tzintzuntzan and Pátzcuaro. Learning about the Purépecha heritage of the region is always very rewarding. It amazes me how their craftsmanship, deep-rooted beliefs, and stunning art have endured through the many stages of Mexico’s evolution, remaining authentic to a time long past.

I used three recipes in particular:
 - Astia Summer
 - Summer Chrome
 - Portra 400

## Tiny wonders

I am a big animal lover, they are the best. There's not much to say besides that.
