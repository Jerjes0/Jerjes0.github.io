Welcome to my little photo gallery! I take most of my pictures with a Fujifilm XT30 ii. I try different recipes and will do my best to label them, but I am a little new in this and don't have yet a very defined style not the best practices for organizing the pictures. 

## Balboa Park and the Japanese Friendship Gardan

These are the first pictures I've taken with my camera so far. It has been a bit hard to understand how to work with the exposure triangule, but fortunately San Diego has very sunny days most of the time, making find good lightning a bit easier. I saw the Cherry Blossom tree's in Washington, DC for the first time when running my first half marathon in 2022. I think they are (alongside the Jacarandas in my hometown) the most beautiful colors I've ever seen. Hearing that San Diego has some, made me very happy.

## Morelia, Michoac√°n

I loved growing in Morelia. I was always very lucky to have amazing friends and good experiences here. The food is amazing, the weather is pretty good, but a little less than in San Diego. I didn't notice the beautiful colors you can see with the Jacarandas, la Cantera Rosa, and so many other iconic colors from here. Starting to take photography a little more 'serious' allowed me to notice this, and I'm very happy I did.

## Tiny wonders

I am a big animal lover, they are the best. There's not much to say besides that.
