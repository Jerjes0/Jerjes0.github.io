# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: |
  I am pursuing my PhD at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at the University of California, San Diego, where my research focuses on applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) for clinical decision-making and scientific discovery. Currently, I am conducting a rotation in the Voytek Lab, doing research on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to advance clinical scientific discovery within neuroscience.

  Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist II at ClimateAi, where I specialized in implementing mathematical and statistical solutions to understand, forecast, and anticipate risks and events related to climate change. My work primarily involved leveraging Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Machine Learning (ML) to predict water availability. During this time, I gained expertise in cloud technologies such as Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, transforming data into actionable insights in climate science.

  Earlier in my career, I served as a Research Trainee at the Fetal-Neonatal Neuroimaging and Developmental Science Center, affiliated with Harvard Medical School. There, I applied ML algorithms for fetal brain age prediction, exploring its potential as a biomarker for identifying atypical development.
